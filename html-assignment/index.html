            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hello! My name is Brooklyn Smith! I was born on July 1<sup>st</sup>, the same day my home nation of Canada gained its independence. I enjoy playing video games such as Chrono Trigger, Xenoblade Chronicles, and the Cat in the Hat for the GameBoy Advance (I'm in second place on the speedrun.com leaderboards for it!), coding, and practicing my Lightsaber skills with my best friend, Riley. I have been attending Algonquin College for a year and a half now, and look forward to completing the <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> program and finally getting to pursue my passion of coding professionally.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is my third attempt at finding a program that I fit into. I first attempted to complete the Game Development program, however I <em>could not due to my inability to draw on command and as instructed</em>. Second, I attempted the Computer Programming program, however I discovered within the first week that it was not what I had anticipated and was not what I was looking for. I am hoping that IMD is the right fit for me and look forward to seeing what it has to offer!
