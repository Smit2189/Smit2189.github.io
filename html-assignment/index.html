            Hello! My name is Brooklyn Smith! I enjoy video games such as Chrono Trigger and Xenoblade Chronicles, coding, and practicing Lightsaber skills with my best friend, Riley. I have been attending Algonquin College for a year and a half now, and look forward to completing the IMD program and finally getting to pursue my passion of coding professionally.

            I attempted to complete the Game Development program prior, however I could not due to my inability to draw on command and as instructed. I also attempted the Computer Programming program, however I discovered within the first week that it was not I had anticipated and that it was not what I was looking for. I am hoping that IMD is the right fit for me and look forward to seeing what it has to offer!
